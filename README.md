# Numerical-Optimization

In this project, I implemented Gradient Descent, Newton, Modified Newton, DFP and BFGS numerical optimization algorithms in C programming language. All of these algorithms are boosted with Armijo step size rule which helps the algorithm to decide an appropriate step size at each iteration.
